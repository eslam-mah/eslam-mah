HeartClipp
A Flutter package providing a custom clipper for creating a heart-shaped clipping path.

Introduction
The HeartClipp class is a custom clipper designed to create a heart-shaped clipping path for use in Flutter applications. It's a simple and elegant way to create heart-shaped views or masks.

Installation
To use the HeartClipp package in your Flutter project, follow these steps:

Add the package to your project's pubspec.yaml file under the dependencies section:

yaml
Copy code
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  heart_clipp: ^1.0.0 # Replace with the desired version
Run flutter pub get to fetch and install the package.

Usage
Here's how to use the HeartClipp class to create a heart-shaped clipping path in your Flutter application:

dart
Copy code
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:heart_clipp/heart_clipp.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('HeartClipp Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: ClipPath(
            clipper: HeartClipp(),
            child: Container(
              width: 200,
              height: 200,
              color: Colors.red,
            ),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
In the example above, we import the HeartClipp class from the heart_clipp package, apply it as a custom clipper using ClipPath, and create a heart-shaped container with a red background color.

Customization
You can adjust the shape of the heart by modifying the control points in the HeartClipp class. Here's how:

dart
Copy code
path.cubicTo(
  size.width,
  halfHeight * 0.8, // Adjust this value to control the top shape
  halfWidth * 1.4,
  -halfHeight * 0.5, // Adjust this value to control the top shape
  halfWidth,
  halfHeight * 0.2, // Adjust this value to control the top shape
);
Feel free to experiment with the control point values to achieve the desired heart shape.
